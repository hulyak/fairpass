# Quick Test Setup (1 Minute)

## Get Test Tokens Instantly

**Direct Asset Hub Faucet:**
```
https://faucet.polkadot.io/westend?parachain=1000
```

### Steps:
1. ✅ Connect your Polkadot.js wallet to FairPass
2. ✅ Copy your wallet address from the app
3. ✅ Go to: https://faucet.polkadot.io/westend?parachain=1000
4. ✅ Paste your address
5. ✅ Complete captcha
6. ✅ Click "Submit"
7. ✅ Get **100 WND on Asset Hub** (no teleport needed!)
8. ✅ Refresh FairPass - balance should show

**Wait time**: ~30 seconds for tokens to appear

## Alternative: Use Demo Mode

Don't want to deal with faucets? Click **"Use Demo Mode"** in the wallet connect modal to test FairPass with a simulated wallet.

Demo mode gives you:
- ✅ Fake balance of 100 WND
- ✅ Simulated transactions
- ✅ All features work
- ✅ No blockchain interaction

## Troubleshooting

### "Balance still shows 0"
- Wait 30 seconds and refresh
- Check browser console for the faucet link
- Make sure you used the **parachain=1000** link (not the regular faucet)

### "Can't connect wallet"
- Install Polkadot.js extension: https://polkadot.js.org/extension/
- Or use **Demo Mode** to test without wallet

---

**That's it!** You're ready to test FairPass. 🎉
